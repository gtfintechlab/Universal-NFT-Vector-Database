## What is the Universal NFT Vector Database

The Universal NFT Vector Database is an initiative started by the Georgia Tech FinTech Lab in an effort to store a vectorized version of every image-based Ethereum NFT (ERC-721). This project leverages a variety of technology to make this possible including Alchemy API, the Graph Protocol, and Milvus.
